## Image Guidelines

- **Profile Images**: 400x500px for main profile, 500x600px for about section
- **Project Images**: 500x300px for project cards
- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web performance

## Current Images

The website currently uses high-quality stock photos from Pexels:
- Profile image: Professional headshot style
- About section: Workspace/coding environment
- Project images: Tech-related, modern aesthetics

## Customization

To use your own images:
1. Add your images to the appropriate subdirectory
2. Update the image paths in `index.html`
3. Ensure images are optimized for web (compressed, appropriate dimensions)

## Icons

The website uses Font Awesome icons by default. Custom icons can be added to the `icons/` directory if needed.
